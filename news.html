New Delhi:
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which seeks independence for Balochistan from Pakistan in a statement said it
took control of a train and kept over 180 passengers, most of them Pakistani soldiers, hostages. Several 
Pakistani military personnel were also killed, the BLA said.
The BLA gave 48 hours to the Pakistani government to release all Baloch political prisoners and "forcibly 
disappeared persons.
The Jaffar Express, with over 450 passengers on board in nine bogies, was on its way from Quetta in Pakistan's
southwestern Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it was fired on, railway officials 
told news agency Reuters.
"Over 450 passengers onboard are being held hostage by gunmen," Muhammad Kashif, a senior railway government 
official in Quetta, told news agency AFP earlier.
AFP also reported, quoting security sources, that Pakistani troops had freed 80 train passengers who were
