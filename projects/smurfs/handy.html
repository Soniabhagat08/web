The Smurfs’ very own Leonardo da Vinci, Handy is a builder and extremely creative inventor. 
This is the guy you call to fix anything—his ears are always alert to the sound of a dripping
 faucet, which he’ll repair in a flash. An original thinker, he’s continually mulling over new 
 inventions. He’s an optimist, believing that every problem has a solution, and that he can 
 build it. He loves developing the latest technological innovation, such as a self-driving 
 wheelbarrow or a diaper-changing robot - though all of them remain medieval and "smurfy" 
 in spirit. At times he comes up with an answer to a question nobody asked — like a portable
  chin rest. The only problem with Handy’s passion is that his contraptions can be so ambitious
   they’re over-engineered, working very well until they create mayhem.

   He is easily identifiable by his navy-blue workman's overalls and a red pencil around on his 
   ear. Handy's overalls were originally green (and occasionally white) and looked slightly 
   different when the outfit was introduced in National Benzole merchandise - though he would 
   be seen with similar green overalls in a 1984 Smurfs trading card collection. Then it was 
   changed to white when the outfit was introduced in the comics, but he would alternate between 
   a normal Smurf outfit and his white overalls between the comic book adaptation of "The Baby 
   Smurf" and "The Clockwork Smurf" and would soon permanently remain with white overalls starting
    with the comic book story "The Aerosmurf". They were soon changed to the current navy blue 
    sometime during the 1990's. In the 1981 cartoon show and movies, his hat has a visor and a 
    yellow pencil.
Prior to the introduction of Handy's overalls to Smurf merchandise, the only thing that visually separates Handy from the other Smurfs was his tendency to carry around a spanner.

In the 1981 series, Handy has a Wisconsin accent.

 <h2>Role In The Village;</h2>

 <p>

Handy is the one who builds all the houses and tools for the Smurfs. He plays a great part in 
the village, being one of the most needed Smurfs. Without him, the Smurfs wouldn't know how to 
fix things the right way.

Handy is often seen building something new in the comics and episodes he appears in.

These inventions include:

Sometimes, though, his inventions either last for one story or are rarely seen.
<br>

He is one of the smartest Smurfs and greatly despises Brainy's pestering and Jokey's jokes.

 </p>

            <h2>
                Personality;
            </h2>
<p>
Handy, as Jokey once remarked, is a very fanatical and driven person. He is often inventing 
something and is so enthusiastic about it that he fails to see how the others think of it.

However, this has put him in a lot of trouble a couple of times. In the comics, when Handy 
invented a handheld powered drill, he began testing it on almost everything in the village, 
and in the process he ruined the bucket of the central well, ruined the barbells of Hefty 
(although Hefty then saw that the iron globes with the added holes could be used as bowling balls,
 so he didn't mind it that much), sunk Marco's boat when he drilled through the hull, and finally 
 ruined the cake mold that Smurfette was planning to use to make the cake for Papa Smurf's
  birthday. After the dough was poured in and went right through the mold, the Smurfs were
   looking very angrily at Jokey, who defended himself with "It wasn't me, you guys, honest!".
    Handy walked in and asked if Smurfette liked the colander he made from that old cake mold 
    and showcasing proudly how he did it using the handheld power drill he made. Realizing that 
    Handy was the one behind all the mayhem that had been going on in the village, the others 
    chased after him, and at the party, they had attached two wooden beams with shoes attached 
    to the drill bit, turning it into a Handy Smurf butt-kicking machine.
    Other instances are shown in the 2021 TV series. In "Diaper Daddy", he invents the titular 
    robot so he didn’t have to change Baby Smurf's diapers, but when the robot goes crazy after 
    a bucket of paint hits his head, Handy does not particularly take responsibility for this.

Without being able to fix or invent things for a certain amount of time, he can go crazy, 
evidenced in "No Smurf Out!".

Handy is also quite friendly. When a Smurf wants his help, he will immediately start 
working on that problem with his inventions. Outside of making inventions for his friends, 
he lets other Smurfs hang around his workshop, which is shown in "The Star Smurf", where 
he initially lets Harmony play his trumpet until he falls out of his workshop due to the loud
 music.
 Although he is friendly and open-minded, there are times when he would end up saying harsh 
 things to his friends and then regretting it later. For example, in "Clockwork Smurfette" 
 after he kept getting in trouble because of his new creation, Clockwork Smurfette, he told 
 her, "I wish I never made you!", causing her to run out of Papa Smurf's laboratory crying. 
 Quickly, he regrets it and says he didn't mean his harsh words. Also, in "One Good Smurf 
 Deserves Another", when Clumsy kept helping Handy, only to make things worse, he told Clumsy
  harshly to stop helping him, hurting Clumsy's feelings. This causes glares from the other
   Smurfs at Handy. He then relents and asks Clumsy for some help.

   Handy can be quite smug at times, especially in "Smurf Your Seat Belts!", where he often 
   argues with Storm, and in "Diaper Daddy", makes a sexist comment about changing Baby’s 
   diapers, saying the job should only be for girls. Smurfette is remarkably bothered by this 
   comment.

<h2>Relationship with Others;</h2>
<p>
      
    <img  class="pic" src="images/fs.jpg" width="350" height="350" align="left" hspace="20" >

    Because Handy invents things that are highly unusual for the Middle Ages, the other Smurfs
     occasionally think of him as strange. For example, in "Foul Weather Smurf", when he said he's
      making a machine to change the weather, most of the Smurfs (even Hefty and Smurfette) 
      laughed at him. Though, they were surprised to see that his invention worked. They do 
      know he is a big help and is needed in building and fixing things.



<br>
<h4>Hefty Smurf</h4>
Handy's closest friend is Hefty Smurf. The two are always seen helping each other or hanging out 
around the village. They watch each other's backs, but sometimes get into fights that just cause 
trouble. In "Romeo And Smurfette", their friendship is almost ruined when a hypnotized Smurfette 
manipulates them into fighting, but they reconcile later on. Big evidence of their friendship is 
seen in episodes like "Smurf The Other Cheek", where they both helped each other out of a small 
jam, and in the Smurf Special "The Smurfic Games", where Hefty and Handy competed against each 
other but in the end their friendship saved their lives.


  <br>
<h4>Clockwork Smurf</h4>
In the cartoon, Handy has a father-son relationship with his invention, Clockwork Smurf. He 
considers Clockwork to be one of his most brilliant creations and sees himself like a father to 
him, as revealed in "The Clockwork Smurf". He often comes to his defense when others 
(such as Brainy) treat him as nothing more than a machine. Whenever Clockwork suffers any 
damage or stops functioning as a result, Handy becomes devastated and works hard to fix him.
 In "Return Of The Clockwork Smurf", Handy is seen sadly cradling his creation in his arms for 
 a moment after he was brought to Smurf Village in critical condition. In "Heart Of Gold", 
 Handy calls himself Clockwork's best friend (as opposed to King Gerard) in an attempt to 
 reason with him after his Heart Of Gold was replaced with a heart of stone.


<h4>Smurfette</h4>
For the first two seasons, Handy had a shy crush on Smurfette. In "Smurf-Colored Glasses", 
he made glasses for Smurfette that were supposed to make anything she sees beautiful, including
 him. His invention almost got her in trouble with Gargamel, but in the end she gave him a kiss
  as thanks for how he saved her. His love for her died though, as his affections shifted toward
   a mermaid named Marina, whom he saved from dying.
   He still might have some feelings for Smurfette, since he entered the Mr. Smurf Contest, which is a 
   contest for the Smurfs who wanted a date with Smurfette, and he was jealous of Wild Smurf with 
   Smurfette in "Wild About Smurfette".

However, in "Diaper Daddy", he says that Smurfette should change Baby's diaper only because 
she is a girl. Smurfette throws a diaper at Handy's face, disgusted at this remark. Despite 
this instance, he still cares about her. In both "Who Nose?" and "Ogre Love", Handy is a part
 of a group of Smurfs that save Smurfette from danger.

    

<h4>Greedy Smurf</h4>

Another Smurf he's seen frequently with in the 1980s series is Greedy. In "The Smurfwalk Cafe", 
they both accidentally invent smurf cream (ice cream) with Handy's air conditioner and set up their 
own cafe. But then they ended up in an argument about who actually came up with the idea and parted. 
They tried to do their own versions of the dessert but were unsuccessful. When they went to the 
mountain to get more snow, they got mixed up in a snowball with Greedy buried in the snow. 
Handy (with the Snowbeast's help) manages to help free Greedy and the two made up.

<h4>Clumsy Smurf</h4>
Handy is also seen frequently with Clumsy, though he can get frustrated with him. In "One Good 
Smurf Deserves Another", after Handy saved Clumsy from Gargamel, Clumsy wanted to repay Handy's
 kindness, accidentally causing trouble for him. Afterwards, Handy harshly told Clumsy to stop 
 helping him and forget what he had done for him, hurting Clumsy's feelings. Seeing the other 
 Smurfs glare at him for that, Handy asks Clumsy to collect wood for him, which Clumsy happily
  agrees to. Handy and the other Smurfs try to solve this problem by making instances where
   Handy can pretend to be in danger and Clumsy will save him, but it continuously ends with
    Handy saving Clumsy instead. The last plan involved Handy being caught by an (unknowingly
     beforehand) real monster, which Clumsy managed to rescue him from, finally making them even.

In "Flying Ace", Handy agrees to Clumsy's idea of flying and in the end, he lets Clumsy "fly" 
around his workshop.

Usually, Clumsy's appearances with Handy has him help Handy with something, such as a ladder or a 
nail, but will end up hurting Handy's hand accidentally.

<h4>Brainy Smurf</h4>

Handy's relationship with Brainy varies. Like the other Smurfs, he's not above arguing with 
Brainy or tossing him out of the village, but other times, he can be friendly with Brainy 
(possibly benefits of doubt). One example in "It's A Smurfy Life", Handy lets Brainy ride 
the Snow Rover with him (which may not be the best idea, since one would figure Brainy would
 mess something up), then Brainy pulls the lever handle and they both crash into a tree, ending
  in them both arguing (and Handy probably wondering what he himself was trying to prove).

In “Good Neighbor Smurf”, Handy was the first to offer letting Brainy stay with him but kicked 
him out when he ruined his invention. Interestingly, Handy said that "Brainy's never right/Brainy's
 ideas never work!", but he ended up saying he was right/agreeing with his ideas more than once,
  though he doesn't seem to admit it.

Handy is friendly towards him at other times, however, often repairs Brainy's smurfway or 
helps him with any of the inventions Brainy wants to use.

<h2>
    In The Movies;
</h2>
<h4>The Smurfs And The Magic Flute;</h4>
<p>
 Handy is seen during the "Just Like Their Names" sequence, exclaiming that he fixed a machine 
 while he sees Clumsy bang his head on several of his tools. He does not have any accessories in
  this movie.
  <h4>The Smurfs (2011)</h4>
  In the 2011 Smurfs movie, Handy is seen working on a bridge in the Smurf Village that Clumsy 
  crosses over, but in doing so he causes the ladder Handy is using to topple, also causing Handy
   to hang on for dear life. Clumsy offers a passing apology to Handy, but Handy simply says to 
   Clumsy he's the reason that his skills are always needed. He also appears along with the other
    Smurfs from the village who went through the portal to help defeat Gargamel.
    In the end credits, he manages the statue of Smurfette built in the middle of the village.

    <h4>The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol</h4>
    Handy appears in The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol as a minor character. He is one of the Smurfs 
    shown opening their gifts (a new hat) and also puts out the Christmas tree fire in the vision
     the Smurf of Christmas Present (Brainy) shows Grouchy.


<h4>The Smurfs 2</h4>
Handy makes an appearance in The Smurfs 2. He is one of the Smurfs working on Smurfette's 
surprise party. However, he notably acts slightly rude towards her, as he tries to avoid her 
to not cause suspicion. He is also seen later dancing with the rest of the Smurfs at Smurfette's
 party.
 <h4>Smurfs: The Lost Village</h4>
 Handy makes an appearance in the CGI-animated film Smurfs: The Lost Village. He attempts 
 to explain what a Smurfette is but fails. He is later seen dancing with Lily at Smurfette's 
 welcoming back party.
