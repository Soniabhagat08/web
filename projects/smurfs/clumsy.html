        <h2>Charater;</h2>
 <p>
   
Clumsy can’t cross a room without falling flat on his face. He is constantly dropping things and 
tripping over his own feet. One might think Clumsy would be covered in casts and bandages, but 
miraculously, he never hurts himself. Sometimes his clumsiness even serves to get the Smurfs out 
of a bad situation.

There's is one good reason for Clumsy's two-left footedness: he's a chronic dreamer, filled with 
wonder and marvel at the world around him. And because he's so busy admiring his surroundings, 
with his head in the clouds, he forgets to pay attention to what's going on under his feet.

Clumsy is easily identified by the droop of his hat, as well as how often he's seen tripping 
and dropping things. In the comics prior to "Smurfs: The Village Behind The Wall", Clumsy was not
 seen with a droop on his hat. Every time there is a competition of some sort, Clumsy is not 
 considered to be a good player due to his clumsiness.

In the Sicredi & Smurfs web series, Clumsy was once more seen without the droop on his hat and 
was often seen with Brainy, Smurfette, and Hefty similar to the 1980s series, Smurfs: The Lost 
Village, and the first set of comic book stories part of The Girls' Village Collection.

 <h2>Personality;</h2>

 <p>
<h4>CComic Book/2021 TV Series Version</h4>
As his name implies, Clumsy is very accident-prone. For example, in his comic appearances like 
"Can't Smurf Progress", he accidentally hits Brainy with a mallet while attempting to do annual 
reparations for the Smurfs' houses, while in the 2021 cartoon series episodes like "DRIIINNGGGGG!", "Kitchen Klutz", and "The Smurfs Show", he is shown to be inept on activities and jobs such as cooking, his job as part of the Smurf Village Fire Brigade, and playing cards. He dislikes being useless towards the other Smurfs whenever his clumsiness gets the better of him, and is determined on finding ways on looking useful, in episodes like "Clumsy Not Clumsy" and "Adventures In Smurfsitting".

Despite his flaws, he is overall the most empathetic, kind, and sensitive Smurf. He has also 
proven to be very heroic when the other Smurfs are in danger.

<br>
<h4>1981 TV Series Version</h4>
In the 1981 cartoon series, this version of Clumsy is an expy of Dopey/Dimwitty with his 
intelligence level being more on the simple minded and dumber side, contrasting to his mainline 
comic book/2021 TV series counterpart having the same intelligence level as the other Smurfs.

During the early development of the 1980s series, he tends to get mad at things that cause him to
 trip and fall, with the most notable example being the Season 2 episode, "The Kaplowey Scroll". 
 In the intro sequence (the ones where the Smurfs run away from Gargamel), it takes Clumsy longer
  to get around the words "THE SMURFS".
  Clumsy had a southern accent and was often seen with Brainy. Clumsy's main interest is collecting 
  rocks and he has full boxes (and/or piles) of them in his house. He is often seen looking for 
  rocks and even claims that he has a lucky one. He also gave a box of them to Nanny Smurf as a 
  housewarming gift in "A House For Nanny". In the 1980s series, Clumsy's catchphrases are 
  "Whoops!", "Golly!", "Gosh!", "Gee", and on some occasions, he says "Yup, yup" when agreeing
   with somebody. He also frequently stutters by saying "Uh".

   He cherishes his friends and tends to go along with what other Smurfs are doing. Despite his 
   clumsy nature, he loves to help out around the village.

            <h2>
                Live-Action Version;
            </h2>
<p>
In The Smurfs and The Smurfs 2, this version of Clumsy is soft-spoken, but still remains friendly 
and happy. He dislikes being left behind by the other Smurfs. He overestimates himself at times, 
and dreams of being a hero, which he becomes in the first movie.

In Smurfs: The Lost Village, Clumsy's personality is a bit more on the eccentric side. He often 
does or says things that result in eye rolls, eyebrow-raising, or (usually intended) laughter 
from his friends. He is also upbeat, yet jumpy and very prone to anxiety. His anxious tendencies 
are reflected in moments such as him having a panic attack in the tunnels, with his mannerisms 
being slightly similar to Scaredy. He is still brave and good-hearted.

    <h4>Brainy Smurf</h4>
While he has no known "Best Smurf Friend" in the comics, in the 1981 TV series, however, Clumsy's best friend, is Brainy. Despite his rather vain personality, Brainy does think of Clumsy as a good friend, even if he won't admit it. Clumsy and Brainy are often paired up when they have to do something in the village, and whenever Brainy has a scheme, Clumsy is his partner. He acts in an assistant role to Brainy, carrying books for him, helping with potions, or listening while he talks. In the episode "The Smurfiest Of Friends", Clumsy states that he thinks Brainy is fun and implies Brainy shares jokes with him often. He seems to admire Brainy for his "intelligence", urging him to escape from the evil imp Buddy without him because "the world needs [him]" in the aforementioned episode. After they escape, Clumsy decides that he'd rather spend time with Brainy than with his other friends back at the village, even telling him that he loves him. He also thinks Brainy is brave and that he has good ideas, as shown in "A Bell For Azrael".

Brainy has been shown to care about their friendship and Clumsy's feelings. As stated in "The Masked Pie Smurfer", he secretly believes that Clumsy is "good for nothing" but still wants to keep Clumsy and his friendship happy.

Despite being Brainy's best friend, there have been instances where Clumsy is annoyed with him, such as in "King Smurf", "Soup A La Smurf", "The Magnifying Mixture", "The Magic Fountain", "Smurf Me No Flowers", "Born Rotten", "Smurf On Wood", and "Small Minded Smurfs". However, it is worth noting that majority of these instances come from the first two seasons (Clumsy is among the Smurfs laughing at Brainy calling himself a leader in "King Smurf"), so it is likely they were not intended to be best friends at first.

In other iterations of the franchise, specifically the 2021 TV series, they do not seem to interact much, and when they do, it is not always positive; in "The Smurfs Show", he is among the Smurfs that call Brainy "annoying", and in "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb", he threatens to break his glasses because Brainy (who had used a brain boosting spell which instead made him dumb) becomes Dimwitty's best friend. However, they are still on slightly better terms than most of the other Smurfs, as Brainy comforts Clumsy when he fears he will smell the forget-me-what flower in "Forget Me What?".

<h4>Dimwitty Smurf</h4>
In the 2021 cartoon show, he and Dimwitty interact a lot as they are part of the Smurf Village Fire
 Brigade. They are almost always seen with each other and are established to be best friends in 
 "You're Fired!" and "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb".

However, Clumsy and Dimwitty have gone under a few conflicts with each other. In "Papa Times Two",
 they argue about who will drive, but the "fake" Papa Smurf confirms that Clumsy can drive, since
  apparently Dimwitty is too dumb, but according to him, Clumsy can't drive. In "You're Fired!", 
  they briefly disband from the fire brigade due to an argument about each other's flaws but make
   up when they are jealous of Smurfette taking over for them. In "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb",
    Dimwitty spends more time with Brainy than Clumsy when Brainy had used a brain-boosting 
    formula, but it instead made him stupid, making the Clumsy jealous. When Brainy drinks a 
    potion that makes him smart again, Clumsy and Dimwitty become friends once more.
  <br>
<h4>Smurfette</h4>
Smurfette is friendly and nice towards Clumsy as he is usually very sweet towards others. The two are 
good friends and Smurfette oftentimes shows a very protective nature towards Clumsy, namely when he's 
being ill-treated by the other Smurfs due to his clumsiness. As was seen during the “The Smurfic 
Games” episode wherein, Smurfette purposely picked Clumsy as her partner to show the other Smurfs
 that winning isn't everything and that having fun is all that matters. Similarly, in "Clumsy Luck" 
 after Clumsy accidently damages Vanity's mirror for seven years of bad luck and Brainy announces that he’s
  bad luck and must be quarantined, Smurfette was one of the few Smurfs that stood up for Clumsy and claimed 
that that was superstitious nonsense and his bad luck was just the result of accidents.
However, she is not above growing angry with him herself if his clumsiness causes trouble to her personally. 
Such as if he breaks something of hers or gets her clothes dirty.

In the 1980s series, Clumsy, just like all the other Smurfs, displayed a romantic interest in Smurfette. 
Though Smurfette did not show any specific interest in any Smurf in particular, she did show Clumsy some 
affection and was one of the few Smurfs that she imagined possibly marrying in the episode "Smurfily Ever After".

His affection towards Smurfette was not necessarily absolute however, as he did also develop a small crush on Pansy, 
an equally clumsy Pussywillow Pixie. In the ending of the 80s series episode, "The Pussywillow Pixies", Pansy 
tries to kiss him only for the two of them to fall and bond over their klutziness. The episode then closes with 
a heart around them when she successfully kisses him on the cheek and he giggles bashfully.
At many times during the live action "non-canonical" Smurfs films, Smurfette cares a lot about Clumsy and 
occasionally worries 
about him. It is implied that she is his love interest in the 2011 and 2013 live-action films.
In the new canonical 2021 series, Clumsy displays a very minor attraction towards Smurfette, such as seen 
when he dreamily waves at her in the episode "The Smurfs Show" and in "Clumsy Not Clumsy" when after his
 name had been changed to Graceful due to the magic amulet Gargamel gave him, Smurfette dances with him and 
 is impressed with his dance moves. Despite this however, he doesn't really seem interested in her as he did in
  the previous series and primarily views her as a friend only. He can even grow jealous of her, as seen in the 
  episode, "You're Fired!" when he and Dimwitty grow envious of her outshining them as firefighters.


  
<h4>Papa Smurf</h4>
One of Clumsy's biggest supporters is Papa Smurf. He considers Clumsy's sensitivity and
 recognizes that his clumsiness is not (naturally) controllable, rarely getting angry at him 
 for such accidents. Because of this, Clumsy is often defended by Papa, who also urges the Smurfs
  to give him a fair chance in everyday group activities, such as smurfball games. When Papa 
  Smurf was given the news that Clumsy had presumably died in "Clumsy Luck", he sat on a mushroom
   and sobbed, mourning "[his] poor Clumsy". After it's revealed he is alive and well, Papa cries
    tears of joy and claims he's "never been so happy to see a Smurf in [his] life".
    However, he is unenthusiastic about Clumsy being one of the rescuers that will save the Smurfs from
     danger in "The Majestic 5" and orders him to go somewhere where he won't destroy anything in "Flying Ace".
    

<h4>Handy Smurf</h4>

Clumsy is also seen frequently with Handy, though he can get frustrated with him. In "One Good 
Smurf Deserves Another", after Handy saved Clumsy from Gargamel, Clumsy wanted to repay Handy's
 kindness, accidentally causing trouble for him. Afterwards, Handy harshly told Clumsy to stop 
 helping him and forget what he had done for him, hurting Clumsy's feelings. Seeing the other 
 Smurfs glare at him for that, Handy asks Clumsy to collect wood for him, which Clumsy happily 
 agrees to. Handy and the other Smurfs try to solve this problem by making instances where Handy 
 can pretend to be in danger and Clumsy will save him, but it continuously ends with Handy saving
  Clumsy instead. The last plan involved Handy being caught by an (unknowingly beforehand) real 
  monster, which Clumsy managed to rescue him from, finally making them even.
   In "Flying Ace", Handy agrees to Clumsy's idea of flying and in the end, he lets Clumsy 
   "fly" around his workshop.

<h4>Hefty Smurf</h4>
Another Smurf seen often in Brainy's company is Hefty, most of the time to clobber him, but during the "The Smurfs Of Order" comic adventure Hefty became Brainy's deputy and the two shared a mutual understanding in upholding the law. Also, in another comic story "A Smurfy Party" when Gargamel was lured into the village and then doused with glue so he couldn't move, Hefty and Brainy did their normal roles, but with a difference.

Brainy: (As Hefty is clobbering Gargamel's foot) No, no Hefty, you shouldn't do that. Remember what Papa Smurf always says: "You shouldn't smurf an enemy when he's down!"
Hefty: (Slamming away) You're right (Boom) I will (Boom) never (boom) do it (Boom) again!



<h4>Other Smurfs</h4>

He is very friendly to (and fond of) animals and even becomes friends with various clumsy 
creatures of the forest, such as a bird called the Hopping crane, a Pussywillow Pixie named 
Pansy, and a little monkey which he called "Chimpy". In Smurfs: The Lost Village, he is shown 
to befriend Spitfire the Dragonfly. In the episode "Fuzzle Trouble", Clumsy temporarily adopts 
a pet Fuzzle.

In the 2011 Smurfs movie, Grace Winslow confided with Clumsy that she too was accident-prone 
    until she met her husband Patrick and encouraged him that he can be more than just his name.

<h2>
    Achievements;
</h2>

<p>
  During "The Smurfic Games", Clumsy was unwanted by the two teams of East and West, so Smurfette
   (upset by Clumsy's mistreatment) pairs with him to make a team of their own, with Clumsy as 
   the captain and Hefty and Handy leading East and West, respectively. After 9 events, each team
    was tied with 3 games won, much to the shock of fellow Smurfs since Clumsy and Smurfette were
     the underdogs.
     The tiebreaker then came: the Smurfathon. When Jokey set off one of his explosive "gifts", 
     Clumsy just blocked his ears, letting Hefty and Handy get a head start. Both of them were 
     then caught in a mishap along the way, and Hefty saves Handy, thus allowing Clumsy to 
     unknowingly overtake. In the end, Clumsy wins the Smurfic Games, being the first Smurf to 
     do so.
     Ironically, Clumsy is one of the Smurfs who often ends up saving the others. While these
      rescues can sometimes be due to a fortunate accident, Clumsy is capable of some quick
       thinking on his own.
In "Predictable Smurfs", Clumsy saves the Smurfs from Gargamel during their annual Spring 
regatta and thus receives the winner's trophy as a reward (which Lazy has no objection to).

In "Clumsy In Command", Clumsy is given the opportunity to lead the expedition to gather purple 
Pandy root on Mount Majestic. He only receives the support (and team) of the Smurflings, as his 
fellow Smurfs are much too worried about the danger his clumsiness could cause on such a hike. 
Brainy argues that he should lead the expedition and Grandpa Smurf suggests making his own team, 
turning the expedition into a race.


Brainy's team think Clumsy doesn't have a chance at winning but fail to succeed in anything besides
 bickering with each other. When a boulder they attempt to climb on dislodges from its spot, the group 
 is trapped rolling down the mountain until it comes to a stop. With quick thinking and rock-collecting 
 knowledge, Clumsy and the Smurflings are able to stabilize the boulder and save Brainy's team. After both 
 parties arrive back at the village, Clumsy receives a trophy, which he attempts to share with Brainy.
<h4>2021 TV Series</h4>

Despite their flaws, Clumsy and Dimwitty are able to do their Fire Brigade job well. 
They are the most 
knowledgeable about firefighting and can tell you whatever it is about their job.

In "The Majestic 5", he was one of the Smurfs who was a part of the rescue team to 
save the Smurfs from Gargamel. He and the other four Smurfs end up saving the day.

In "Flying Ace", he and Handy attempt to stop Handy's out of control plane. They 
successfully stop it before it crashes or one of them gets hurt.

In "I'm Off To The Circus!", he stops Gargamel and Azrael from stealing the Smurfs,
 who disguised themselves as acrobats. Clumsy, just learning about this, defeats them 
 using his clumsiness.
