        <h2>Charater;</h2>
 <p>
   
Brainy Smurf thinks he’s smarter than he really is, and he is certain that he’s smarter than 
everyone else. This is a Smurf who does not suffer from self-doubt. In fact, he refuses to admit
 when he’s wrong, and whenever someone proves it, he makes up an excuse.

Brainy considers himself the most responsible member of the band and has proclaimed 
himself the right-hand man to Papa Smurf. He’s often repeating phrases such as, "Like Papa 
Smurf always says…" or "Papa Smurf is always right, and when he says that…" (and at times he 
finishes his sentences with the word "Right?"). The other Smurfs just roll their eyes and find 
inventive ways to shut him up. One running gag is that they "eject" him from the scene - unseen 
to the audience, an annoyed Smurf gives him a wallop in the butt (a kick), and we see him flying 
through the air.

Despite his tendency to sometimes act like a spoilsport, he's still respected and deeply loved by
 the village. As long as he's not pushing his luck...

Between the release of "Little Comics Collection" version of "The Hundredth Smurf" and before 
the album release of "The Black Smurfs" (Brainy's glasses were originally exclusive to the 1961
 Smurfs cartoon show prior to the album release of "The Black Smurfs"), the only thing that 
 visually separates Brainy from the other Smurfs is his tendency to use his declarative finger 
 when he makes speeches.

 <h2>Personality;</h2>

 <p>
Comic Book/2021 TV Series Version
Brainy is the most self-centered of the Smurfs, even more so than Vanity; he annoys almost everyone, up to and including Papa Smurf. Brainy has a penchant for showing off, claiming that he knows everything about everything, although the only things he knows well are things about himself... and even that is debatable. Brainy even claims to be his own favorite subject. Despite this, he is well-liked whenever he's not being a bossy know-it-all, which is all-too-frequently the case.

His house is filled with of stacks of books all written by himself. The books are either manuals or encyclopedias. Brainy always wants someone to read them, but even the nicest people turn them down... or merely pretend to like them for Brainy's benefit. He enjoys being a leader, always eager to be one in almost any activity. He's dramatic in nature, often inflating problems or freaking out far more than other Smurfs, which can lead to them yelling at him. In general, he's not very patient.

Brainy is very cowardly. In one episode of the 2021 cartoon show, he is faced with the possibility of getting eaten by Azrael or Gargamel and panics. When the Smurfs rescue him, he believes Gargamel and Azrael are back and he suggests eating Dimwitty. When he gets out of the pot he was in, he says he was joking, but he doesn't sound very convincing. In "Where's Papa Smurf?", when Brainy hits Papa Smurf in an accident with his smurfway, he unsuccessfully blames Clumsy for it.

Brainy constantly fails to use his intelligence constructively and for the benefit of other Smurfs, including himself. He almost always believes his book-smarts are better than the hand-on smarts of the other Smurfs, which leads him to be either whacked in the head (often with a mallet), booted out of the village, or in a rivalry with another Smurf, where Brainy eventually humiliates himself. Basically, Brainy is a bruised ego who consistently bruises it himself. In the 2021 TV series, Brainy is a lot less egotistical and more knowledgeable and smarter. He still brags about being smart and still annoying, but he is very kind, caring, humble, and selfless.

Despite his little patience for tricks and fun, it does not always seem this way. In "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb", Clumsy and Dimwitty are alerted from the bell as members of the fire brigade, but it turns out that Brainy is just enjoying playing on the ladder. However, he denies that he was doing this when Clumsy and Dimwitty see him, as they would be surprised to see such a serious Smurf playing.

            <h2>
                Role in the Village;
            </h2>
<p>
Apart from being Papa Smurf's apprentice, Brainy can (more often than not) be the primary or 
supporting source of discourse within the village. While he is knowledgeable when it comes to 
magic and potion making, Brainy often over-estimates himself, or doesn’t clearly follow directions, 
thinking that his way is best, which can cause many problems for both him and everyone else.

He will often nosily police Smurfs doing their jobs or chores as if he was an expert, even 
though it's incredibly rare it actually helps. Occasionally, he inspects Smurfs at night, 
though he often gets hit by a Smurf who wants him to be quiet. In the 2021 cartoon series, 
he is often seen doing this with a smurfway, which is a parody of segways.
Brainy causes a lot of problems for the Smurfs sometimes. This is mostly because all he does is 
make things worse.

An example is when he forced everyone to be so quiet in "Unsound Smurfs", that not even a needle
 can drop, only because Papa Smurf wanted some peace and quiet to get some sleep. He went so far
  to make everything quiet, he cast a sound-proof barrier around the village that made no sound 
  get in or out, but this also prevented anyone else from entering.
  He also believes that he is smarter than everyone else and that he should be in charge. Sadly, 
  most of his ideas (such as mind-controlling in "Smurf, Yes Smurf!") go wrong, and he usually 
  finds a scapegoat for the mishaps he causes.

<h2>Relationship with Others;</h2>
<p>
      <img  class="pic" src="images/sm.jpg" width="350" height="350" align="right" hspace="20" >
"We have this annoying Smurf who lives in our village who wears spectacles and is always going 
that we 'Should beware' and that we're 'Not supposed to be like that' and 'I'll tell Papa Smurf 
about that if you don't'. We all dislike him because of his constant meddling."
"What?! But I..." (He's forcibly silenced)


<br>
Brainy is the least liked out of all the Smurfs. This is proven in the episode "The Masked Pie 
Smurfer". A masked Smurf has given every Smurf a chance to get back at someone they dislike by 
just giving him some smurfberries. In exchange for the berries, the Masked Pie Smurfer will throw
 Pie at the designated Smurf's face. Unfortunately for Brainy, he was a main target. If the Smurfs
  play pranks on one another, Brainy is often involved.
  <br>

  In "The Talented Justa Smurf", he is one of the Smurfs that Justa (who had just become "Mimic
   Smurf") imitates. He is visibly annoyed by his imitation while all of the Smurfs laugh. This 
   is more proof that various Smurfs dislike his ramblings.
   <br>
   In the comic book "King Smurf", he is convinced that the Smurfs will elect him to replace Papa 
   Smurf during his absence, but he ultimately receives only two votes, his own and Dopey's.
   <br>
   The main reason why the Smurfs dislike him is due to his endless chattering and his occasional use 
   of abusing his role as Papa Smurf's assistant. In "Brainy Gets Ghosted!", he uses his authority to 
   boss Painter and Chef around because there is an upcoming event that Papa Smurf is going to perform at.
    During his bossing around, he throws out all of Painter's paintings of Papa Smurf that "do not look good" 
    to him and eats several of Chef's desserts, claiming that as Papa Smurf's assistant, he gets to "taste test"
     his meals. Both of these interactions are what directly lead to Painter and Chef attempting to prank him.
<br>
<h4>Papa Smurf</h4>
Being Papa Smurf's assistant and apprentice, Brainy seems to always pester him and if the leader thinks of a plan, he will always say "That's exactly what I was thinking!". It isn't a secret that Brainy is such an admirer of Papa Smurf, always wanting to be like him in some way, and always defending Papa Smurf's wisdom even if it's only to gain some advantage over his fellow Smurfs. If Brainy Smurf is threatened or mistreated by a fellow Smurf, or if things don't go the way he wants them to, he'll usually spout, "I'm going to tell this to Papa Smurf". Even though Brainy is constantly hit in the head with a mallet or thrown out of the Village, Papa Smurf appears to be the Smurf that best knows how to put Brainy in his place. In the "The Smurf's Apprentice" episode, Papa declines Clumsy's offer to be his assistant, as Brainy is "more than enough". Brainy once referred to his own assistant role as "self-appointed" in "Born Rotten", implying Papa Smurf himself didn't assign him the job
Their relationship becomes more strained by the end of the 1981 series (most notably the ninth season), with Papa Smurf often openly expressing any frustration he feels toward Brainy instead of trying to approach it with a patient or gentle attitude. That was usually Papa's best attempt to avoid yelling at Brainy, although his apprentice had pushed him to such a boiling point more than once before. In "Cave Smurfs", when Brainy tried to help Papa Smurf reassemble the time crystals by dropping one on top of the structure being assembled, causing it to collapse, Papa Smurf became so mad that he booted Brainy outside the cave, with him being inside his own book.
    

<h4>Clumsy Smurf</h4>

Due to being a major nuisance towards the other Smurfs, Brainy doesn't seem to have an actual "Best Smurf Friend" in most iterations of the franchise. Though exclusively in the 1981 television series, his best friend, and the only Smurf who enjoyed Brainy's company, is Clumsy Smurf.

At first glance, it would seem that their friendship is only one sided, as Brainy sees Clumsy as an annoyance, but this is proven untrue in "The Dark-Ness Monster", where Brainy and Clumsy’s friendship is developed the most when Brainy can finally relate to Clumsy’s own experience in being, well, clumsy. Once he loses his glasses, Clumsy agrees to help him around the village and he tells Clumsy that he ‘actually trusts him with his life’ and that ‘being clumsy isn’t so bad, when he’s with him’, as well as writing him a very heartfelt quotation: 'It is easy to pretend we are strong. It is much harder to admit we are weak. A true friend, by loving every part of us, teaches us to love our weaknesses.' After reading, he allows Clumsy to keep the scroll, even offering him all of his quotations if he wanted them.

The two often seen (or are appointed to) watch(ing) Baby Smurf together and are together around the village more often than not. Overall, while Brainy does get frustrated with him, there are episodes where they get along perfectly fine, such as in "Dreamy's Pen Pals" and "The Gingerbread Smurfs". He even expresses great concern about Clumsy being missing in "The Pussywillow Pixies" and being hurt in "The Chief Record Smurf" (where he also says, "Your best friend would never let you down!").

In other iterations of the franchise, specifically the 2021 TV series, they do not seem to interact much, and when they do, it is not always positive; in "The Smurfs Show", he is among the Smurfs that call Brainy "annoying", and in "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb", he threatens to break his glasses because Brainy (who had used a brain boosting spell which instead made him dumb) becomes Dimwitty's best friend. However, they are still on slightly better terms than most of the other Smurfs, as Brainy comforts Clumsy when he fears he will smell the forget-me-what flower in "Forget Me What?".

<h4>Hefty Smurf</h4>
Another Smurf seen often in Brainy's company is Hefty, most of the time to clobber him, but during the "The Smurfs Of Order" comic adventure Hefty became Brainy's deputy and the two shared a mutual understanding in upholding the law. Also, in another comic story "A Smurfy Party" when Gargamel was lured into the village and then doused with glue so he couldn't move, Hefty and Brainy did their normal roles, but with a difference.

Brainy: (As Hefty is clobbering Gargamel's foot) No, no Hefty, you shouldn't do that. Remember what Papa Smurf always says: "You shouldn't smurf an enemy when he's down!"
Hefty: (Slamming away) You're right (Boom) I will (Boom) never (boom) do it (Boom) again!

<h4>Smurfette</h4>

Brainy is considered friends with Smurfette. They are often seen together, teaming up regularly in episodes such as "Mind The Cat".

Unlike other Smurfs, Brainy does not always want Smurfette in a romantic way. Brainy often doesn't appear in episodes in which Smurfette wants one of the Smurfs to be her escort to parties, such as "Prince Smurf". However, Smurfette is often annoyed with his talking, though the only thing Smurfette hates about Brainy more than his endless speaking and egoism is when all the other Smurfs are mean to him. This goes to show Smurfette is one of the few Smurfs who likes him more no matter how much talking he does.

<h4>Other Smurfs</h4>

Often in the comics, Brainy could be heard off-panel typically yammering didactically, and one Smurf would get visibly annoyed at him and walk to him off-panel. Then a loud *PAF!* could be heard.
In the movie "The Smurfs And The Magic Flute", following more closely to the comic book portrayals of Brainy, he usually gets clobbered in the head by a hammer when he gets too annoying to bear. This is funny because in the original comic book story that the movie is based on, he doesn't even appear at all.

Also, in the comics during the Annual Imitate festival, Brainy for once gets to be the one who does the clobbering, when he takes the role of Hefty and Poet takes the role as Brainy, the scene shows Brainy trying to lift Hefty's halter and Poet lecturing Brainy and ends with Brainy chasing Poet with a hammer trying to clobber him.

But deep down, some of the other Smurfs love him and would be horrified if something bad happened to him. In "Doctor Brainy & Mister Dumb", when Brainy used a brain-boosting machine, the machine instead makes him stupid. Papa Smurf and Smurfette try to help him turn back into his real smart self.

<h2>
    The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf;
</h2>

<p>
   Brainy appears in one of the levels of The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf as a playable character. 
   He takes up the Smurfizer and sets out to recover the Agua Magnifica, the first of these 
   ingredients. He rescues Jokey and Handy from Viletraps along the way, before arriving in 
   Wild Smurf’s territory. He then traverses Wild’s incomplete ropes course to locate the Agua
    Magnifica, which to his disappointment is only water from a particular waterfall. Brainy 
    returns to Smurf Village but must then set out again to rescue Dimwitty from a Viletrap 
    before it can alert Gargamel to the village’s location.
