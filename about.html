<h1> History </h1>

<p>
Genting Hong Kong ordered two ships of the class in May 2016 from its subsidiary Lloyd Werft Group for service
in the Star Cruises fleet, with delivery of the first vessel planned for 2019.[3] In July 2016, Genting Hong 
Kong reorganized Lloyd Werft Group, resulting in the formation of MV Werften as a builder of large cruise 
ships; accordingly, the Global class order was transferred to Dream Cruises.
At the time they were ordered, the design of the ships had not been completed, and as a result construction 
did not begin until March 2018, when ceremonial steel cuttings for the first ship in the class were held at 
shipyards in Wismar and Rostock. Major components of the ships were constructed at both shipyards, with 
assembly taking place in Wismar. Construction was scheduled to take just under three years, with the first 
ship to be delivered in late 2020 and the second in late 2021.
In March 2018, Genting Hong Kong announced that the two planned Global-class ships would be operated by Dream 
Cruises upon delivery, sailing from Chinese ports during the summer season and further afield in Southeast 
Asia, Oceania and the west coast of the United States during the remainder of the year.
The construction of the first ship, Global Dream, started on 8 March 2018 at the facilities in Wismar and 
Rostock.[10] The keel was laid on 11 September 2018 in Rostock.[5] A big part of the ship left the drydock 
in Rostock on 22 November 2019[11] and was towed to Wismar, where she entered the drydock on 23 November 2019.
Due to the temporary closure of the shipyard in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of 
both Global-class ships was expected to be delayed.[15] On November 16, 2022, Disney Cruise Line purchased 
Global Dream for €40 million, a discount from the original value of €1.8 billion, and is powered by methanol.
The post-Disney design will provide 2,111 passenger cabins, allowing for 6,000 passengers. Disney worked with 
the shipbuilding company Meyer Werft to complete the ship by the time she enters service and embarks on her 
maiden voyage in 2025.[16] She will be the first Disney Cruise Ship to be based outside of the United States
 market, set to be homeported in Singapore.[17][18] On September 8, 2023, the ship was officially announced 
as the Disney Adventure at the Destination D23 Expo.[19] The interior design was done by Estonia-based group
LTH-Baas.Construction is planned to be completed in May 2025,[22] with a maiden voyage on December 15, 2025.

<h1> Design </h1>
The ship was originally planned to measure 201,000 gross tonnage (GT), but was increased to 208,000 GT in the
 final design.[3] The ship is 342 metres (1,122 ft 1 in) in length, with a beam of 46.4 metres (152 ft 3 in) 
and a draft of 9.5 metres (31 ft 2 in).[8] The ship is powered by six MAN Diesel & Turbo 48/60CR diesel 
engines, which make a total of 96,000 kilowatts (129,000 hp) and power three ABB Azipod XO thrusters via ABB 
ACS6080 variable frequency drives.ABB also supplied major control components and software.
The ship was planned to use artificial intelligence and robots for many customer-facing services, with 
extensive use of voice and face recognition.[27] The pre-Disney design provided for 2,350 passenger cabins 
allowing for 9,000 passengers, 4,700 of those in lower berths. Her crew was to be 2,200.The post-Disney 
design will provide 2,111 passenger cabins, allowing for 6,000 passengers.
