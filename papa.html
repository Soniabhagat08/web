        <h2>Papa Smurf is the wise and respected leader of the Smurfs;</h2>
 <p>
   
   Papa Smurf is one of the protagonists from the comic strip The Smurfs.
   Most Smurfs are said to be about 100 years old, but at the advanced age of 546
    (553 in the 1980s series episode "The Littlest Giant"), Papa is the oldest Smurf 
    and the leader of all Smurfs. Despite his age, he is still quite energetic. 
    Easily distinguishable from all the other Smurfs, Papa Smurf has a bushy white mustache
     and beard and is typically dressed in red pants and a matching red Phrygian cap, making 
     him the only Smurf who does not wear white. He was introduced in Peyo's 1958 Johan and 
     Peewit story "La Flûte à Six Trous", the first appearance of the Smurfs.
     Don Messick provided Papa Smurf's voice for the 1980s animated series as well as the 
     special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. Jonathan Winters, who voiced Grandpa Smurf on the
      animated series, was Papa Smurf's voice for the 2011 film and its 2013 sequel, with the 
      latter being Winters' last film before his death.[4] On The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol and 
      The Smurfs: The Legend of Smurfy Hollow, Papa Smurf is voiced by Jack Angel.[5] Mandy 
      Patinkin voiced Papa Smurf in the animated film Smurfs: The Lost Village.[6] Davis Freeman 
      currently voices Papa Smurf in the 2021 Smurfs reboot. In the original French version,
       Papa Smurf's name is "Le Grand Schtroumpf” which means "the Great Smurf" or "the Big Smurf."

 <h2>History;</h2>
 Papa Smurf debuted in 1958 and is a gentle, humble, and knowledgeable village elder. As the 
 Smurfs' leader, Papa is a central father figure that the Smurfs typically go to when seeking 
 counsel. Due to his fatherly nature, Papa Smurf is always concerned about the Smurfs’ welfare 
 and harmony. He is very altruistic and is always available to help anybody, whether Smurf or 
 human.
 His great diplomatic skills are used when encountering humans or other creatures in the
  forest.In the original comic books by Peyo, Papa Smurf has a much more forceful personality 
  than in other portrayals. He is often portrayed in these comics as a cantankerous and irritable
   leader. In these comics, Papa has little patience and becomes easily angry with the Smurfs for
    being disobedient or making mistakes. However, in the 1981 series, he is a calm leader.
    Papa Smurf's duty is to ensure that all the Smurfs of the village get along and respect each 
    other. When real chaos arises, Papa Smurf usually resorts to drastic measures, often through 
    the use of magic. For example, Papa switched bodies with the antagonist Gargamel in order to 
    pretend to attack the village ("Smurf Versus Smurf" comic adventure/"Romeo and Smurfette" 
    TV episode). In another instance, he creates an entire village full of evil doubles of the 
    original Smurfs ("The Smurf Menace" issue).
    While Papa Smurf sometimes prefers to not have to constantly fix problems, he realizes that 
    it is his calling. He once said that since he may not be able to be the village leader forever,
     every Smurf should have a brief experience of commanding the village. To do so, Papa handed 
     over his signature red hat, allowing each Smurf the chance to direct others on a construction
      project. The Smurfs were then referred to as "Papa Greedy", "Papa Clumsy" or "Mama Smurfette," 
      depending on whose turn it was to be the village leader.[when?][where?] While Papa did see the 
      importance of each Smurf gaining leadership skills, his true purpose was to guide the Smurfs and
       help fix their problems and mistakes.
       When he is not actively acting as the leader or helping other Smurfs, Papa Smurf indulges in his 
       favorite hobby: magical chemistry, or alchemy. He often makes elixirs to help Smurfs who get into 
       trouble. The Belgian comic portrays Papa Smurf constantly preparing magical drinks from white hellebore.
        The drawings that portray the effects of these alchemical brews are shown as both turbulent and amusing.
         Aside from his house, he also has a laboratory containing several chemical devices. Papa Smurf often tries
          to create potions to help the Smurfs but sometimes fails; such as the time he accidentally created a 
          substance that turned any living thing into a huge monster (see the album: The Smurfs and the Cracoucass
           and the cartoon episode "The Smurfs and the Howlibird"). He occasionally leaves the village in order to
            obtain the necessary ingredients for his potions.
