Comic Book/2021 TV series Version
A true esthete of food, he is above all a glutton whose stomach is never full enough. 
He harasses Chef all the time about the dinner menu. "What are we smurfing tonight? Maybe I 
should taste it just in case..." And if Chef refuses him, he's going to steal his dish and make 
him run after him.
The only thing that separates Greedy from the other Smurfs is his tendency to carry or eat food, 
he is rarely seen wearing an orange or pink neckerchief. While in The Baby Smurf and Smurf Versus 
Smurf, he had temporarily worn a chef attire matching that of Chef and Baker Smurf's attire as he
 was once portrayed as the village baker. In the 2021 TV series, he is additionally distinguished
  with frost stains in his mouth (depending on the episode).
  Despite being separate from his 1981 cartoon counterpart, Greedy is shown (or mentioned to be)
   cooking and baking twice or so in the original comics preceding the show's creation. The most
    significant instance of this being The Smurfette, where Greedy is seen decorating a cake he 
    baked for Smurfette and angrily investigating when it gets stolen. In The Astro Smurf,
     Harmony apologizes for accidentally reading off a recipe he borrowed from Greedy. He was 
     also once portrayed as the village baker in The Baby Smurf, as it was an adaptation of the
      cartoon episode and took specific elements from it.
      However, the few mentions of Greedy cooking or baking in past comics were misattributed to
       Baker in the modern English translations by Papercutz. The reason for this is unknown, 
       though it could've been to avoid confusion among new readers or an attempt to fully reflect
        the current Smurfs canon.

This version of Greedy would also appear in the 2021 TV series.
This version of Greedy Smurf is an amalgamation of the comic book Greedy as well as Baker. He is 
the village chef who is responsible for keeping the village well-fed with his cooking skills. 
However, there are episodes where Greedy is invited to parties held by other Smurfs where the 
food provided doesn't seem to be catered by him, which may suggest that he isn't the only one 
who can cook or bake, though this is never quite touched upon in a consistent fashion.
He is usually identified by a modified Smurf hat that resembles a chef's hat, and a napkin tied 
around his neck. The latter is often forgotten by the animators or ditched in favor of a scarf 
for the winter or a piece of clothing for a special occasion, such as a black bowtie for the 
first (and only) Golden Smurf Award event.

 <h2>Role In The Village;</h2>

 <p>

Being the food glutton of the village, Greedy generally does not have a specific job in the 
mainstream comic books and 2021 TV series. However, he is occasionally seen cooking in a few 
comic book stories and was assigned Baker's role as the village cook in the 1981 TV series.

 </p>
 <hr>

            <h2>
                Personality;
            </h2>
<p>
As his name implies, Greedy is a major food fanatic who tends to eat and hoard goodies from the
 other Smurfs (most notably from Chef and Baker). In the 1981 TV series, he also sometimes uses 
 food-related exclamations and idioms, such as "Great smurfin' sugar cookies!" and "cut the 
 mustard".

He may be named Greedy, but he's actually quite generous. He helps Chef deliver his souffle in
 "Souffle Shuffle" and is seemingly very inclined to share his food with others, even strangers,
  such as in "Greedy Goes On Strike" right before he gets captured. It's also implied in that 
  episode and previously stated in "The Bad Place" that Greedy doesn't enjoy eating alone 
  (unless he's having a midnight snack) or cooking for just himself, proving further that he
   finds joy in cooking meals for others, as long as they appreciate his work and don't overwork
    him. However, it's his own personal gluttony that's the reason he deserves to be called 
    'Greedy Smurf'.

    Greedy also has a good heart. In "Waffles And Punishment", he feels guilty for cheating in
     his contest of waffle eating against Lily. After Chef offering him some waffles after the 
     contest, he confesses his feelings. Though Lily is upset at first, she accepts his apology 
     and is declared the real winner.

On a ton of occasions, Greedy tends to think more with his stomach than his head, resulting in 
situations he often regrets getting into afterwards, which can be anything from a couple of 
really bad stomach-aches to unintentionally getting himself or other Smurfs captured by Gargamel
 or another villain such as The Ninja Rat in Season 9's "Karate Clumsy".
 In the 1981 TV series, similar to Chef and Baker Smurf, Greedy also tends to get irritated or 
 lose his temper often, usually as a result of someone stealing or destroying one of his many 
 beloved desserts and meals. When he does, it is usually not for long or very extreme depending 
 on the circumstance. He is often seen joining the village's occasional panicked frenzies and 
 angry mobs, such as in "Memory Melons".

Despite this, Greedy does not get very violent outside of using pastries or baking ingredients 
as weapons or whacking a Smurf with a wooden spoon (such as Brainy in "The Master Smurf" and an 
attempted swing at Gawogga Wogga and Snappy in "Snappy's Puppet"). The most violent he has ever 
gotten was arguably in "The Smurfwalk Cafe", as he is shown throwing chairs (one occupied by a 
terrified Brainy) off-screen in a fit of rage. In "Big Shot Smurfs", Greedy claims "[he's] an 
eater, not a fighter", but then agrees to become the Downhorns' giant general when he learns 
food will be his reward if he helps them defeat the Uphorns. Given that his only motivation is
 to win more food, he proves to be as incompetent of a general as Brainy.
 All in all, Greedy has a big heart and cares about his friends just as much as (if not more than)
  his food. The last thing he wants is for any Smurf to go hungry, which is notably shown in "The 
  Master Smurf" when Greedy brings food to Miner so he wouldn't miss a meal as he's hacking away 
  in the mines. In "The Smurfs And The Money Tree", Greedy never treats any of the Smurfs badly 
  of his own accord, only taking orders from the Devil Smurf that lived within the tree who 
  claimed to be "the real [him]". When he finds himself disinterested by the belongings the 
  Smurfs traded him for the golden goodies, he gets upset and misses their company terribly.
   Greedy later claims his friends are his real "fortune", implying he wouldn't trade them for 
   anything in the world.

<h2>Relationship with Others;</h2>
<p>
      
    <img  class="pic" src="images/fs.jpg" width="350" height="350" align="left" hspace="20" >
In the 1980s cartoon show, Greedy is friends with practically every Smurf. He has no real
 Smurf best friend as they all seem to have fun with him or help him carry or create his food
  from time to time. He does dislike his fellow Smurfs taking his love of cooking for granted,
   as in the story "Greedy Goes On Strike" he purposely walks out on his job when he sees that 
   even Smurfette doesn't give him a well-deserved break.

He also allows the Smurflings to help him in his kitchen or serve the Smurfs, such as in the
 episodes "Denisa's Greedy Doll" and "Greedy Goes On Strike". He also sometimes offers them 
 recently baked treats, such as cupcakes in "Snappy's Way" (although this interaction is 
 ruined by Snappy's own greediness).
 In the episode "The Smurfwalk Cafe", Greedy and Handy accidentally create smurf cream, resulting
  in them forming a partnership and running The Smurfwalk Cafe. The duo act very friendly toward 
  each other for a short time until they lash out and dismantle the cafe over which one of them 
  should be credited for creating the dessert. After their individual attempts at producing the 
  dessert fail, the two go to gather more ice upon the same mountain occupied by the Snowbeast. 
  Unfortunately, Gargamel is already near the peak forming a huge snowball, planning to crush 
   village. With the help of the Snowbeast, Gargamel is defeated, but Greedy gets trapped beneath
    the snow as a result. Handy, distressed, digs him out with help and the two happily rekindle 
    their partnership and wish to continue serving smurf cream together.
    Greedy gets very agitated by Brainy's meddling in his various cooking and baking activities,
     hating to be criticized by an amateur. Sick of Brainy's comments in "The Gingerbread Smurfs",
      Greedy challenges him to a bake-off and the two are to bake gingerbread cookies. The Smurfs 
      show overwhelming support for Greedy, much to Brainy's dismay. After Brainy creates groups 
      of chaotic living Gingerbread Smurfs, he desperately asks Greedy for help. The chef agrees,
       if only to show him that a professional knows what they're doing. He succeeds, showing
        Brainy that "amateurs [often] overlook the obvious": putting out the oven's fire.
        Greedy seemed to have had the worst attitude toward Sweepy out of the entire village. 
        He gets extremely frustrated during an unexpected visit from him, Sweepy cleaning out 
        Greedy's chimney and more importantly, wanting to clean his stovepipe. Greedy angrily 
        tells him he'll have him clean it when he's ready and orders him out. He swaps this
         attitude for a more positive one for a short time later, believing along with the 
         rest of the Smurfs that Sweepy's handshake brings good luck. However, after he discovers
          his new pies are inedible, he hurls a slice at Sweepy as he visits and tells him he'd 
          never let him in his home again, thinking his unluckiness is to blame. This attitude of
           course changes once more at the end of the episode, after Sweepy becomes a now beloved
            hero.

In the comics and 2021 series, Greedy is often seen chased or being scolded by Chef as he 
consistently steals something new made by him. In various episodes of the 2021 TV series, he is
 also Chef's frequent customer for the food that he serves as established in "Chef Soup". Despite
  his greediness for food, Greedy does show concern for Chef's plight such as being one of the
   Smurfs rescuing him from Bigmouth and helping him deliver his souffle for the Spring Festival
    in "Souffle Shuffle".
    Greedy's taste in food had once saved Chef from being accused of being the Masked Pie 
    Smurfer in "The Aerosmurf". In the story, the Smurfs first suspect Chef of being the Smurf
     that pied them until Greedy taste tested Chef's pie and the pie that the Smurfs got hit 
     with and concluded that Chef was innocent.

       <h2>Trivia;</h2>
       <p>
    <pre>

.Greedy is allergic to pollen, as shown in the episode "Bewitched, Bothered, And Be-Smurfed" when the room full of flowers summoned by Hogatha's (at the time, Smurfette's) magic locket makes him sneeze.

.Greedy's mouth has frosting stains from muffins in the 2021 series. Depending on the episode, it will be orange (from carrot muffins) or purple (from raspberry muffins).

.Greedy is alongside Papa Smurf and Brainy as the only character to appear in every 1980s Season 1 episode.

.In the 1980s cartoon, it turns out that he is so well liked by his fellow Smurfs (or they considered the possibility of him enjoying the pie, thus ruining the point of getting someone pie-smurfed) that he didn't become a target in the episode "The Masked Pie Smurfer," so he had to paint a target on his face in order to actually get pie-smurfed.

.Like the majority of the Smurfs, Greedy seems to be good with animals (especially when it comes to feeding them). He is seen happily throwing smurfberries to a visiting carrier bird sent by Lord Balthazar in "Handy's Kite", cheese to a rat (and himself) in "The Man In The Moon", and cupcakes to a very hungry Puppy in "Have You Smurfed Your Pet, Today?".

.Greedy has a reasonably cool head in the face of crisis in "The Smurfette" episode when he is tricked by the Gargamel-controlled Smurfette to open the dam's sluice gate in order to flood the village. After Smurfette damages the control lever, Greedy belays himself down by a rope and manages to force the gate closed by himself. However, in the comic book, it is Poet Smurf who shows the dam to Smurfette, but the only exception that it's him who breaks the lever as he tries to close the dam and gets berated by Smurfette while she was the one who wanted to see it.

.He, Papa, Grandpa, Baby, Smurfette, Brainy, Clumsy, Hefty, Handy, Grouchy, Lazy, Vanity, Jokey, Painter, Wild, Sassette, Snappy, and Smoogle are the only characters who time traveled during Season 9 with the Time Scrolls.

.Greedy had his name in six episode titles which are "Gormandizing Greedy", "Greedy And The Porridge Pot", "Breakfast At Greedy's", "Greedy Goes On Strike", "Denisa's Greedy Doll", and "Greedy's Master Pizza".
