    CHENNAI: The Chennai Mahila Court on Monday sentenced the sole accused in the Anna University rape case, A Gnanasekaran, to life imprisonment.
     He must undergo at least 30 years of imprisonment.
    Mahila Court Judge M Rajalakshmi passed the order four days after declaring him guilty of all 11 charges framed, including rape.
    On December 24, a complaint was lodged by the survivor at the Kotturpuram All Women Police Station (AWPS), alleging that Gnanasekaran 
    threatened her when she was with a male friend on the 
    university campus and then raped her. According to the prosecution, Gnanasekaran recorded the act on his mobile phone.
    As the identity of the victim was leaked in the public domain on December 26, the Madras High Court constituted an all-women
     Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case.
    On February 24, the SIT completed the probe and filed a 100-page charge sheet before the jurisdictional magistrate. On March 7,
     the case was transferred to the Mahila Court, which framed charges against Gnanasekaran under sections 329 (criminal trespass),
      126(2) (wrongful restraint),
     87 (abduction of a woman), 127(2), 75(2) read with 75(i), (ii), (iii), 76, 64(1) (rape), 351(3), 238(b) of BNS and BNSS,

        <h2 >2.Operation Spider Web: How Ukrainian Drones Reached Deep Inside Russian Territory;</h2>
<p>
    <img src="Photos/news2.jpg" width="650" height="400" align="right" hspace="20">
    
    Russia-Ukraine Conflict: Over three years into the war, Ukraine has unleashed one of its lethal strikes 
    deep inside Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy termed the attack named 'Spider Web' a 
    brilliant operation. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine started preparing for the operation over a year and a 
    half ago and 117 drones were used. He said that 34% of the strategic cruise missile carriers stationed 
    at Russian air bases were hit.According to the reports, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) struck at 
    least 41 aircraft, which it claimed were used to bomb Ukrainian cities. These included Tu-22 and Tu-95 
    strategic bombers and the A-50 radar detection and command aircraft. This is the first time that Ukraine
     has hit targets thousands of kilometres deep into Russian territory from the borders.So, how did 
     Ukrainian drones reach deep inside Russia? Notably, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) had hidden the 
     drones in wooden pallets that were housed in cargo containers. Trucks were used to smuggle the containers
      to the nearby areas of the Russian bases. The drivers were clueless about the presence of drones.
      Since the drones have limited battery range, so flying them all the way from borders to thousands of
       kilometres inside Russia was not possible. Therefore, they were smuggled inside Russia using cargo containers. 
       The wooden pallets were designed in such a way that container lids could be removed remotely, allowing the munition
        drones to take off and hit the targets.Ukraine claimed that it hit Russian military planes worth $7 billion in drone 
        strikes. "$7 billion: This is the estimated cost of the enemy's strategic aviation, which was hit today as a result
         of the SBU's special operation," the agency announced on social media.Russia, confirming the incident, stated that the 
         attacks were repelled in the regions of Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur."No casualties were reported either among servicemen or 
         civilians. Some of those involved in the terror attacks were detained," the Russian defence ministry said in a statement 
         on Sunday. It added that in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions, drones launched from areas near the airfields caused several 
         aircraft to catch fire, while there were no casualties among military personnel or civilian staff."Our people operated across
          several Russian regions -- in three different time zones. It's genuinely satisfying when something I authorised a year and six
           months ago comes to fruition and deprives Russians of over forty units of strategic aviation. We will continue this work," Zelenskyy added.
           Russia acknowledged that several of its aircraft "caught fire" in the attacks.
         "As a result of the launch of FPV drones from territories in close proximity to military airfields in the Murmansk and Irkutsk Regions, several aircraft 
       caught fire. The fires were extinguished," the Russian defence ministry's statement read.
        Meanwhile, on Monday, Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to hold the second round of direct talks in Istanbul.

   the rising river level, the vehicle cannot be located... We could locate a few mobile phones and identity cards, which 
   we kept in the police station, but no trace of the missing individuals. Something like a dead body was visible. The body
    is at such a location in the cliff that we could not see it either through the u or by crossing the river with a lifeboat.”
    A downpour in the northeast region, including the states of Sikkim, Manipur, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam, is causing floods and landslides.

Rs. 4 lakh would be provided to the families of those who lost their lives in this disaster.
